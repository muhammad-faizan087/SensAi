1. clerkMiddleware and auth
Where auth comes from?

The auth parameter is provided automatically by clerkMiddleware.

When you call clerkMiddleware(callback), Clerk injects an auth function as the first argument to your callback.

If the user is signed in, auth() returns data like:

{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "sessionId": "sess_456",
  "getToken": [Function]
}


If the user is not signed in, userId will be null.
